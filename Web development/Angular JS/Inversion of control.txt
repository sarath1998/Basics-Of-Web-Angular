Inversion of control -- 

genral ga user code library ni call chestadi, if we r using some 
libraries in our code.

If we r using FRrameworks, then we need to develop the application
in a standardized way. Here what happens, is Frameworks will provide 
all the background, just u need to provide the code of ours.

When we run the application, the flow of control is from 
Framework to users code unlike a normal appication.

Hence control is being reversed..
