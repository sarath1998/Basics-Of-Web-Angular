To achieve this, we use ng-view, ng-template and 
$routeprovider service directive



$routeprovider is a key service which sets the configuration of URLs, 
,maps them with the corresponding HTML page

$routeprovider service is used in Youtube application, at the time 
of internship in vizag. once see the the code.(app.js file)

Points to remember

routeProvider is defined as a function under config 
of module using key as '$routeProvider'.

$routeProvider.when defines a URL which is mapped to a HTML page, 
that should be present in the same path as main HTML page. 

"otherwise" is used to set the default view.

"controller" is used to set the corresponding controller for the view.
