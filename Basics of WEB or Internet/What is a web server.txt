Static web server and Dynamic web server

A dyanmic web server contains an additional software namely
"Application software" and "Database" that updates the content 
on the pages before responding to the request.

For eg, Wikipedia contains only some defined set of templates,
but contains huge information in database. Hence, it is of dynamic
web server type.


A static web server does not perform any updation.They just transfer
the pages as it is..

What is a protocol

A protocol defines set of rules for the communication between 
two devices(computers).

Communication between two devices requires some agreement on the
format of how data to be exchnaged. The set of rules that defines
the format is called a Protocol.

Stateless Protocol

Neither the Server nor the Client remember previous communications.
For example, relying on HTTP alone, a server cannot remeber a 
password you typed or what step you are on in a transaction.
You need an application server for tasks like that.
