First, setup proxy setting in Android Studio.

Inside Android Studio-->Choose mode of view of project as "Android"

Expand Resource Bundle 'gradle' Directory

Open gradle.properties 

Proxy setting will be available..see whether they 
are correct and fine..If not, modify them and retry


In file Explore,
C:\Users\windows user\.gradle

Goto this path and edit the details in it..Use Visual Studio Code 
to open such file extensions..

For me, In gitam N/w proxy password is missing, I filled
the field with the password and retried. It worked.
